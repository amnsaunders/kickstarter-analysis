campaings tend to happen in the spring between March and May with goals between 20,000 and 30,000. The greatest challenge has been ensuring that the

are less than 25,000. There is a positive trend in successful campaings 25,000 and 35,000 before it plateaus at 
from 35,000 to about 43,000.

identified. 

## Results

- The main conclutions of this analysis is that the most successful campaing would be theaters, begining between March and May with goals of 20,000 to 30,000

- Limitations: The greatest limitation of this data set is the inability to identify why campaigns are failing when they start in the Summer and Fall.  

- An additional chart and table that could be created with this dataset is which campaings launched between March-May, the aveage lenght of the campaings, and
 what were their volume goals.
